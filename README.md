# CUI Time-Table to Dataset

A utility for myself so it's easier to find free time slots and other info.
<br>Files:

- `pdf_to_img.py`: Convert and export all pages to png files to `out/`
- `img_ocr.py`: Extract timetable info from each png and save as a .csv dataset to `out-csv/manual.csv`
- `analysis.ipynb`: Analyze the dataset for insights and finding relevant info
